    "### Getting Data from APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs, or application programming interfaces, are created by companies and organisations to provide restricted access to data. It is very common to get data from APIs for data analysis, for example, you can get financial data (stock prices etc.), social media data (Facebook, Twitter etc. provide APIs), weather data, data about healthcare, music, food and drinks, and from almost every domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from being rich sources of data, there are other reasons to use APIs:\n",
    "- When the data is being updated in real time. If you use downloaded CSV files, you'll have to download data manually, and update your analysis multiple times. Through APIs, you can automate the process of getting real-time data.\n",
    "- Easy access to structured and verified data - though you can scrape websites, APIs can directly provide data in structured format, and is of better quality\n",
    "- Access to restricted data: You cannot scrape all websites easily, and that's often illegal (e.g. Facebook, financial data etc.). APIs are the only way to get this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more reasons depending on the use cases and the domain of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of useful APIs is available here: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Case: Google Maps Geocoding API\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Maps provides many APIs, one of which is the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start?authuser=1\">Google Maps Geocoding API</a>. You can use it to geocode addresses, i.e. get the latitude-longitude coordinates, and vice-versa. \n",
    "    \n",
    "To use the API, go to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/\">Google Developers</a>, get an API key, and go to the Geocoding API page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have an API key, getting the geocoded data of an address is easy. For e.g., if you want to geocode the address \"UpGrad, Nishuvi building, Anne Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai\", you need to separate the words using a \"+\", and provide the address and your API key in this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=UpGrad,+Nishuvi+building,+Anne+Besant+Road,+Worli,+Mumbai&key=YOUR_API_KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this is a two step process:\n",
    "- Join the words in the address by a plus and convert it to a form ```words+in+the+address``` \n",
    "- Connect to the URL by appending the address and the API key\n",
    "- Get a response from the API and convert it to a python object (here, a dictionary)\n"
